                    Ark of magic is the biggest project I have worked on. It is a 3D, multiplayer (MOBA) game developed in Unity. I have been working on it since 2020, and it is the project I have learn Unity in. 
                    It has gone through multiple architectural changes, and I have covered almost all of the development, with some minor help from my friends.
